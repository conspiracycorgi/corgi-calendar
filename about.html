      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The Corgi Consciousness Calendar was created to help corgi owners better understand and anticipate their pet's moods, energy levels, and behavior patterns based on lunar cycles.</p>
      <p>Just as the moon affects tides and natural rhythms on Earth, we believe it can influence your corgi's behavior in subtle but meaningful ways. By tracking these patterns, you can create a more harmonious relationship with your furry friend.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our calendar divides each lunar month into 28 days, with special emphasis on the four main lunar phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Moon (L1):</strong> A time of new beginnings when your corgi may feel adventurous and ready to explore.</li>
        <li><strong>First Quarter (L8):</strong> A period of growth and activity when your corgi is likely to be playful and social.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Moon (L15):</strong> A time of culmination when your corgi may feel peaceful and receptive to gentle affection.</li>
        <li><strong>Last Quarter (L22):</strong> A period of reflection when your corgi might benefit from mental stimulation and thoughtful activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each day on the calendar provides a predicted mood for your corgi and suggests activities that align with their energy level for that day.</p>

      <p>To get the most out of the Corgi Consciousness Calendar:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>Pay attention to how your corgi's behavior correlates with the lunar phases.</li>

      <p>Remember that each corgi is unique, and while the calendar provides general guidance, your pet may have individual patterns and preferences.</p>
